Before two meet I have anew installed Windows and since him functions nobody preset more of me :(, then has made from frustration still a sometimes Windiws new and it has not improved really something, to the homepage FFmpeg I have already contacted, however, the response I have agreed nothing says me, knows ned what him meant.  Maybe one of you can help me and takes one moment around with me the problem to solve :).   I had written this on the page FFmpeg to the support.
